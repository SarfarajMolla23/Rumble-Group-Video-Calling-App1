# Features

 1. Create a Room:

  Users can create a room by entering their name and a unique room ID.
  Click Go to Room to enter the created room.
  
  2. Join and Start Video:

   In the room, click the Join button at the bottom to start your video feed.
   
  3. Participant List:

  The left sidebar displays the number of participants in the room along with their names.
  
  4. Group Chat:

The right sidebar allows for group chat, which is visible to all participants in the room.
The chat includes a "Rumble Bot" that greets each participant by name upon joining and notifies everyone when a participant leaves.

   5. Leave Room:

  When a participant clicks the Leave button, they will stop transmitting audio and video but 
  will still remain in the room as a viewer, similar to a live stream.
  The participant can continue to view the chat and interact, but they cannot broadcast video 
  or audio.
  Their name will remain visible on the participant list to indicate they are still in the room.
